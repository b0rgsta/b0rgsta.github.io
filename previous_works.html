            I created these vector images using Adobe Illustrator while studying
            Multi-Media Design at Raffles College of Design - Sydney.

            <p>
              I am a self-taught prosthetic designer and sculpter. I learned the
              art of making prosthetics via online research/watching some free
              online video tutorials. I was able to execute high levels of
              artistic expression during this process and was surprised by what
              I was able to create given that I had no previous experience
              working with clay.

            Here are some of the wood-work projects that I have designed and
            built. Lighting design is certainly an interest of mine and I often
            encorporate it into the designs of my personal projects wherever I
            see fit.

            Here are a few Lyno Print artworks that I made. My self discovery
            with art began in 2007 and these lyno prints were the first pieces
            of art that I made.
